# ECE-5725-Final-Project-Luxor-
This repository contains all of our code files

Chances are that at one point in your lifetime you have watched a Pixar movie. In every introduction they have Luxor, the lamp that jumps on top of the letter ‘i’. There’s also a two-minute short film about Luxor Sr. and Luxor Jr. Through inspiration of these iconic, animated lamps, we decided to create Luxor the III. This version of Luxor is a companion that tracks and shines light on a single object while studying or doing work. The key to tracking an object is with a Picamera and an Aruco marker.  You are allowed to have nine objects with Aruco markers, but it will only track the one indicated. The user interfaces with this standalone, wireless lamp using the PiTFT screen. 

Luxor the III was created for Cornell University’s ECE 5725 Embedded Operating Systems course final project. It is brought to you by Diego Horna and Deepthi Krovvidi, with the assistance of Professor Skovira and teaching assistants.
